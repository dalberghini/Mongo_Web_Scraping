# Mongo_Web_Scraping
Several urls were given with instructions to scrape those sites in various ways.

All titles of articles as well as snippets of the beginning of the articles were scraped.

Photos of all four hemispheres of Mars were taken as well as a table of facts about Mars.

The most updated featured image was taken and posted with the rest of this data on an html via a flask app that had the scraping function referenced in it.

The jupyter notebook sumbitted is nearly identical to the scraping python script and the app references that script and the index.html found in the templates folder.

Screenshots of the finished HTML are in the images folder.

A bootstrap grid was used to create the HMTL, but limited styling was implemented due to the coder's lack of creativity.
